# Jasmine Testing
 Have used Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application

## How it works
 1. Clone the project to local macine
 2. Just Open the index.html page in any web browser, Test cases will run automatically(Jasmine is already    included) and will show result at the bottom of page.
